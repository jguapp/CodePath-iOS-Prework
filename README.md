## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Some of my favorite apps include:

- **Academia**: I love this app because it has a really clean UI and it allows me to read research papers from a large variety of different subjects. I also love the recommendation algorithm which sends you an email every so often about the next paper you should read. These recommendations are always on point and I've enjoyed every paper they've recommended to me so far.
- **Google Calendar**: I've tried a variety of calendar apps but Google Calendar has by far been the best. Not only is adding events seamless, but the UI is also very aesthetically pleasing. It also allows me to have a separate list for tasks and reminders for them which combined with the calendar allows me to stay on top of everything. Also the ability to have addons makes it even more appealing even though I haven't used any of them yet.
- **Finch**: This is a very important app for me. As someone with ADHD it's really hard for me to get certain tasks done throughout the day but Finch helps keep me accountable. By taking care of myself and getting things done, I'm able to care for a virtual pet and keep them happy.

## App Idea

Booklet is a reader app  crafted for avid readers who prefer to engage with their content on the go. Designed to enhance the mobile reading experience, Booklet supports interactions with diverse types of reading materials and offers tools for in-depth analysis and understanding directly within the app.

## Key Features

- **Upload Flexibility**: Users can upload PDF files, connect and import books from other reading apps, or directly input links to articles, integrating all their reading materials in one convenient app.
- **Dynamic Highlighting**: Offers highlighting tools that not only allow users to mark important text but also categorize highlights with custom color codes and attach notes to them in order to deeper analyze the text.
- **Personalized Dictionary**: Booklet allows for readers to save words that they don't know and look them up to save into a personalized dictionary, which tracks and organizes searched terms to enhance vocabulary and understanding.
- **Interactive Learning**: The app includes quizzes and flashcards generated from the user's dictionary and highlights to reinforce learning and retention of new words and concepts.
- **Smart AI Companion**: Built-in AI that users can interact with about their current reading material, offering summaries, discussing themes, and analyzing character development to enrich the reading experience.

## Notes

In terms of challenges, I did have trouble adding the slider. Once I saw that a slider was one of the UI elements that I could add to my app, I knew that I had to add it to my app to allow users to change the background color to whichever one they want. What was difficult about it was getting the gradient to be integrated into the slider instead of hovering on top of it which too me a while to fix.
